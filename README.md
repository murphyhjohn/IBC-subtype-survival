## Introduction

This project is for Cohort Studies (EPID 8010) at the University of Georgia in Fall 2024. This repo serves as a place for me to store all materials neccesary to reproduce the project, including the data, code, and final manuscript.

## Research Question

The research question that this project aims to answer is, "How is molecular subtype associated with overall survival in adult women with inflammatory breast cancer?"
