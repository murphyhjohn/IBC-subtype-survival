# Results

This folder contains the figures and tables in .png and .rds form that
are presented in my manuscript.

`figures` contains `flowchart.png` and `loglog_plot.png` which are my
Figures 1 and 2, respectively. They were created by `flowchart.R` and
`loglog-plots.R` in the `code/analysis` folder.

`tables` contains `t1.rds`, `t2.rds`, `t3.rds`, and `t4.rds` which are
my Tables 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. They were created by `table1.R`,
`table2.R`, `table3.R`, and `table4.R` in the `code/analysis` folder.
